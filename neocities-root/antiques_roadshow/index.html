            the global economy is a huge web of resource flow and transactions<br><br>

            at one end, there’s constant death and suffering<br><br>

            at another end, there’s you tapping on your phone<br><br>

            these two things are connected. often by fewer degrees than you realize<br><br>

            the question is not “whose fault is this”<br><br>

            i can always tell that i love you<br>
            you send me lots of texts nowadays<br>
            because we’re really far apart<br>
            my life is pretty much delimited by them<br>
            in between, im drinking coffee<br>
            and always typing away at some dumb shit<br>
            but when i see your name there again<br>
            and im reminded that i know you<br>
            immediately<br>
            i can tell!<br>
            <br>
            if “know” meant “love”,<br>
            then<br>
            uh.<br>
            then i would uh<br>
            wait lemme start over<br>
            <br>
            the back stage man with the cane<br>
            cant pull me from here<br>
            so i could really just say “i love you”<br>
            into the mic forever<br>
            ill make this bar go out of business<br>

            theres much i can do, and theres much i can feel<br>
            fortunately, choices dont often leave me paralyzed<br>
            unfortunately, i might make the wrong choice<br>
            <br>
            maybe ill end up on the wrong side of a historical murderous tidal wave. maybe ill have less fun. maybe ill let my equals suffer.<br>
            <br>
            maybeeeeEEReeE maybe,,,, theres something else under the rock that only glows in the sunlight<br>
            as im turning it over, maybe i’ll be helped<br>
            theres much i can see on the way<br>
            fortunately, ive got lots of love to give<br>
            unfortunately, my face is a dense and gummed-up grating<br>
            <br>
            maybe though we’ll work it out and be fulfilled. maybe ive got lots of God juice to spare. maybe i’ll save the world.<br>
            <br>
            Maybe! in a curtain-drawn room where everything makes me terrifatigued<br>
            there’s a hidden treasure chest<br>
            in plain sight. that i dont deserve. that i corrupt by opening.<br>
            that i will open anyways.<br>
            maybe im more scared of my treasure loving me back<br>
            maybe my treasure will pull me in and bite through my neck<br>
            so i, a head, can just fall through your endless tunnel of gold and crystals<br>
            watch the glimmering and shimmering. listen to the sparkle and sheen. taste the rock candy.<br>
            while blood drips out of me to float above<br>
            dispersing sensory love into the atmosphere you keep for me<br>
            maybe ill never notice that im falling in a circle<br>
            and all i need to be happy is for you to rub your tummy<br>
            and let me know you’re still out there<br>
            <br>
            unfortunately, nothing matters<br>
            fortunately, nothing matters

            heys lut,<br>
            in a trench deeper than everest is high<br>
            we all succumb to deep-sea gigantism eventually<br>
            are you nervous? are you gonna be embarrassed?<br>
            about your massive hyper-cock?<br>
            its okay. you can stay with us. its normal here.<br>
            besides, its easier to find your friends<br>
            fingering through the blue-black haze<br>
            when everyone’s packing like crazy<br>
            <br>
            you might be thinking, since we’re so tolerant,<br>
            why not just stay like you are?<br>
            they’ll judge you for looking like us<br>
            but we won’t judge you for looking like them<br>
            why not take the benefits of our community<br>
            without giving up the fashion of smallness?<br>
            i cant stop you<br>
            and one person can shovel diatomaceous ooze their whole life<br>
            and it would be fine. it’ll replenish<br>
            <br>
            everyone takes and everyone gives<br>
            and yes, you may be just one drop in an oceanic current<br>
            but you are still you. and you still have a choice<br>
            you could remain in a comfortable in-between<br>
            that would be fine. i dont know much about that,<br>
            but im sure its fine and fun<br>
            <br>
            or, you could fall down the trench and not stop yourself<br>
            quickly mold into our liquid puzzle piece<br>
            sleep soundly on your dick like a body pillow<br>
            hug and massage your friends to feed the ooze<br>
            love yourself like everyone, everyone like yourself<br>
            go fuzzy and gooey. spread out and break apart to join the medium
