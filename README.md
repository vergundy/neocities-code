# neocities-code
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my website at vergundy.neocities.org

The *neocities-root* directory contains all the essential directories and
code that make up my website as they appear on my neocities dashboard. This 
repo does not contain any of the many images that are on my neocities file 
system, and it exists mainly for reference and recovery purposes.

I wrote all of this in the neocities editor, so it's not very well-formatted
or hygienic.

I will try to keep this repo up-to-date with any major changes I make to the
site.
